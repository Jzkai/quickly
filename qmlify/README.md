QMLify is a build tool for compiling ES6 and Node.js-like code into the custom Javascript used by QML. It is a part of the [Quickly](https://github.com/iBeliever/quickly), which provides polyfills and Node modules to emulate a Node.js environment.

For more details, see the [Quickly](http://quickly.readthedocs.org) documentation.

### Installation

The easiest way to install QMLify is to install it globally using npm:

    npm install -g qmlify

You can also use QMLify via the Node.js API, though this is currently undocumented.
